# Number-Plate-Recognition

Project was made for Computer Vision classes.

# Purpose of the project:
The aim of the project was to write a license plate recognition program.

# The photos were taken with a smartphone or a camera with the following assumptions:
-number plates in the pictures will be inclined not more than Â± 45 degrees to the horizontal position,
-the longer edge of the number plate covers over one third of the photo width,
-the angle between the optical axis of the camera and the plate plane does not exceed 45 degrees,
-ordinary plates are photographed, with black characters on a white background (7 characters).

# Requirements:
Programs should be written in Python version 3.7, using the OpenCV library.
It is possible to use external libraries (e.g. scikit-image), but it is not allowed to use external OCR modules or ready-made, trained models that enable reading characters.
